## Documentation

The [`docs/`](./docs/) directory contains a document that explains some of the
intuition behind the solution. A [pre-built PDF](./docs/d_07.pdf) is included
in the directory along with its LaTeX source. To build the PDF from source,
install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (or similar) and run `latexmk`
inside `docs/`.
